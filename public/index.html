		<h3> Why doesn't the new thing ever solve my old problems? </h3>
		<p>
			ERP & CRM systems were supposed to achieve cross-channel collaboration and data sharing.
			Robotic Process Automation was supposed to bridge the the gap between these sysetms.
			Integration Platforms were supposed to get different systems talking together.
			AI was supposed to make all all of this irrelevant.
		</p>
		<p>
			But why do we still have all of these disparate systems -- and they're still not talking together?  
			You need to have a plan, and a way to make these systems work together.  And reduce the number of pieces holding your business together.
